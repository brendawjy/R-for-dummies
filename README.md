# *econometrics-for-dummies*
My journey of learning to use R for econometrics. I will use this repository to document my progress of using R for econometrics purposes. I have a feeling that someday I would look at this repo the same way I look at my diary entries in the early 2000s ðŸ––.  


As an Indonesian, my research interest lies in Indonesia's economics development. I aspire to deepen my study in the inequality of opportunity topics. There will be some rambles, concise explanations, and mostly graphs probably. Because what better way to summarize something than to visualize it as simple as possible huh? Va bene, andiamo.
