# *econometrics-for-dummies*
My journey of learning to use R for econometrics. I will use this repository to document my progress of using R for econometrics purposes. I have a feeling that someday I would look at this repo the same way I look at my diary entries in the early 2000s ðŸ––.  


As an Indonesian, my research interest lies in Indonesia's economics development. I aspire to deepen my study in the inequality of opportunity topics. There will be some rambles, concise explanations, and mostly graphs probably. Because what better way to summarize something than to visualize it as simple as possible huh? Va bene, andiamo.

# *Chicago Booth Course*
My journey of looking for a research assistantship position has been full of ups and downs

I have learned the basics of R and SQL for months, and I've been really looking for a position where I can actually practice those skills

I do realize that I am far from skilled in these tools, hence my journey is divided between actively looking for a research assistant position (internship, part-time, full-time, you name it), and casually looking for resources that can help me improve my skills

Along the way, I found this course by Chicago Booth. They provide resources to learn R and Stata for data science purposes (they even mention "Data Science for Research Assistant" :")) I choose to focus on R.

Here's the website [Chicago Booth Course](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/43117)

I would say this course is quite beginner friendly. I will try to do the exercises and post the results here. They do have the solution for every practice problems though. But anyway it never hurts to do it by yourself

## Basics module - Problem 1
In the first exercise of Basics module, we will work on College dataset that contains the data from 777 different universities and colleges in the US.
You can download the dataset here [College dataset](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/43117/pages/r-module-1-basics) It is under the heading 'Practice, problems, data, code'
