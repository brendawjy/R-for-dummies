#load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#set the working directory into where you store the file in your computer
setwd("C:/Users/brend/Documents/Data analytics course/R_course_ChicagoBooth/Basics")

#import the file with read.csv and store it in a dataset which we'll call college
college <- read.csv("College.csv")
#note that if you just write read.csv("College.csv"), it will be printed immediately in your console (which can be quite messy) and isn't stored as a dataset yet
#so remember to always store your imported data as a dataset

#have a quicklook at your dataset
view(college) 
#this will open a window above the R console (if you're using RStudio)
#As someone who is used to Excel and now struggling to learn about coding, i find this function very pleasant

#you can also use the glimpse function
glimpse(college)
