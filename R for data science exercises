Chapter 1: Data Visualization with ggplot2

Exercise on page 6:
1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
Answer: Nothing, this just tells ggplot that the datasource is a dataset called mpg

2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
Answer: dim(mtcars); the result is 32 rows (observations) and 11 columns (variables)

3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
Answer: ?mpg; drv: the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl.
ggplot(data=mpg)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=cyl, y=hwy)

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful?
there is still scatterplot, but not meaningful, because both class and drv are character variables

Codes:
#load the necessary package
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggplot2)

#to answer the second question
data(mtcars) #to load the mtcars dataset
summary(mtcars) #to check out some basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) about each variable
dim(mtcars) #to get the dimension (number of rows and columns) of the dataset

#to answer the 3rd and 4th question
data(mpg) #to load the mpg dataset
?mpg #to get some information about the variables in mpg dataset
#cyl is number of cylinders, hwy is highway miles per gallon (showing fuel's efficiency on the highway)
ggplot(data=mpg)
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=cyl, y=hwy)
