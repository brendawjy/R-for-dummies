Chapter 1: Data Visualization with ggplot2
Exercise on page 6:
1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
Answer: Nothing, this just tells ggplot that the datasource is a dataset called mpg

2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?

3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to
find out.
4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl.

Codes:
library(tidyverse) #load the necessary package
data(mtcars) #to load the mpg dataset
summary(mtcars) #to check out some basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) about each variable
